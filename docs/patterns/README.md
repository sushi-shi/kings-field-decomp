# Compiler and MIPS pattern notes

Reusable, evidence-backed observations about the retail code generation and
about which source shapes reproduce it under the current probes. Each note
records the retail evidence first and the probe behaviour second; none of them
promotes a probe to a proven historical toolchain.

- [gcc257-epilogue-and-scheduling.md](gcc257-epilogue-and-scheduling.md):
  the framed-epilogue delay-slot form, the checked `div` expansion, and the
  prologue/load scheduling that separate the GCC 2.5.7 probe from the 2.6.0
  probe, with the corpus numbers behind the profile change.
- [source-shapes-gcc257.md](source-shapes-gcc257.md): source shapes that
  decided exact matches under the 2.5.7 probe (loop counters, return-value
  joins, struct copies, two-statement accumulations).
