# Compiler and MIPS pattern notes

Reusable, evidence-backed observations about the retail code generation and
about which source shapes reproduce it under the current probes. Each note
records the retail evidence first and the probe behaviour second; none of them
promotes a probe to a proven historical toolchain.

- [gcc257-epilogue-and-scheduling.md](gcc257-epilogue-and-scheduling.md):
  the framed-epilogue delay-slot form, the checked `div` expansion, and the
  prologue/load scheduling that separate the GCC 2.5.7 probe from the 2.6.0
  probe, with the corpus numbers behind the profile change.
- [source-shapes-gcc257.md](source-shapes-gcc257.md): source shapes that
  decided exact matches under the 2.5.7 probe (loop counters, return-value
  joins, struct copies, two-statement accumulations).
- [compiler-attribution.md](compiler-attribution.md): a dedicated
  cross-version pass over the residue corpus. How GCC 2.4.1 CC1PSX was made
  runnable (a go32-stub frankenbinary under DOSBox) and the finding that it
  reproduces retail no better than 2.5.7 `-O2` (byte-identical on most residue
  functions, worse where it diverges); the residue ceiling is an unattributed
  scheduling/regalloc residue, and `-mcpu=r2000` is a per-TU discriminator, not
  a global truth.
- [psyq-cpe-tail-and-bss.md](psyq-cpe-tail-and-bss.md): the CPE v1 prefix
  embedded at GAME's initialized-data tail, and why referenced storage inside
  the final page can still be original BSS rather than initialized source data.
- [open-map-render-residue.md](open-map-render-residue.md): RTBL window
  ownership, conflicting light-matrix base forms in map rendering and
  initialization, and the visibility-traversal setup residue.
- [open-floor-item-render-residue.md](open-floor-item-render-residue.md):
  typed floor-item sprite descriptors and the extra facing-byte mask shared
  by the GAME and OPEN retail renderers.
